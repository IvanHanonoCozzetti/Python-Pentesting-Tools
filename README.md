# Python-Pentesting-Tools
## Penetration testing tools using Python scripts for analysis and testing.

### Nmap Scanner:
* Ip status
* Protocol being used (**TCP** or UDP**)
* Open ports (numbers)
### Scans:
- Verbose output (detailed output)
- SYN/ACK scan
- Service Fingerprinting/Enumeration
- Default Scripts
- Aggressive scan
- Operating System Detection
#### Range of ports for scanning: 1-1024


## Port Scanner:
This tool will display if the port that you are scanning is open or closed, upon IP and Port numbers, using Socket.


## Proxy for Pentesting:
A simple tool that allows you to hide your IP while performing a scan from your source-code editor/command-line interface.

## Banner Grabber:
A banner grabbing attack against any protocol can reveal insecure and vulnerable applications which could lead to service exploitation and compromise.
